This project Successfully connects multiple data sources such as Postgres, csv file, json files etc.. and reads them using linked services leveraging **Azure data factory** and loads the data into the **Azure blob storage**.

Applied transformations on **Azure Databricks** using **SQL** and **pyspark** on the data which is being pulled from **Azure blob storage** by mounting the data.

By connecting to **Snowflake** from **Azure databricks** and moved the transformed or cleansed data to **snowflake cloud warehouse**.

I have leveraged **GitHub** integration from Azure data factory to push the code here.

Apart from this,it also contains some **python** programs.
