'''Challenge #7:
Day 7: A String Range Write a function called string_range that takes a single number and returns a string of its range. 
The string characters should be separated by dots(.) For example, if you pass 6 as an argument, 
your function should return ‘0.1.2.3.4.5’.  
Extra Challenge: Dictionary of Names You are given a list of names, 
and you are asked to write a code that returns all the names that start with ‘S’. 
Your code should return a dictionary of all the names that start with S and how many times they appear in the dictionary.
 Here is a list below:  names = ["Joseph","Nathan", "Sasha", "Kelly", "Muhammad", "Jabulani", "Sera”, "Patel", "Sera”] 
 Your code should return: {“Sasha”: 1, “Sera”: 2}'''
