'''Challenge #6:
Day 6: User Name Generator Write a function called user_name that generates a username from the user’s email. 
The code should ask the user to input an email and the code should return everything before the @ sign as their user name. 
For example, if someone enters ben@gmail.com, the code should return ben as their user name.  
Extra Challenge: Zero Both Ends 
Write a function called zeroed code that takes a list of numbers as an argument. 
The code should zero (0) the first and the last number in the list. For example, if the input is [2, 5, 7, 8, 9], 
your code should return [0, 5, 7, 8, 0].'''

def user_name():
    email= input("enter your email id:")
    name= email.split('@')
    print(name[0])
user_name()

def zeroed(input):
    input[0]=0
    input[len(input)-1]=0
    print(input)
input=[2,5,7,8,9]   
zeroed(input)
